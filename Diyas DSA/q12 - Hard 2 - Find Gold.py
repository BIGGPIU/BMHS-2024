'''
You are on an island looking for gold.
You must find and return where the gold is located.

Node Structure:
Class Node:
    self.up = Node | None
    self.down = Node | None
    self.right = Node | None
    self.left = Node | None
    self.gold = bool ( if the gold is here, True. If the gold is not here, False )
    self.nick = int ( used for debugging to identify the Node. You may return this value )

Restrictions:
There will always be gold present 

Every row of the linked list will have an equal amount of nodes
as an example this: 
[0,0]
[0]
will never be a test case

>CHALLENGE< 
1. You cannot visit the same node more than once.
2. Implement a X first Search (BFS,DFS) algorithm
