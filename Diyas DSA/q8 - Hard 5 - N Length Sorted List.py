'''
You are given one larger list of numbers. you must return a sorted list of the Nth largest numbers
It does not matter if the solution is sorted least to greatest or greatest to least.


EXAMPLE 1:

N = 3 
l = [1,2,3,4,5]

ANSWER:
[3,4,5]

EXAMPLE 2:
N = 1
l = [100,2,5,6]

ANSWER:
[100]

Restrictions

1 < N < 10
1 < l < 100
1 < len(l) < 20
The list will contain no duplicates

>> CHALLENGE <<
Complete this problem without using any pre made sorting algorithms 
ex: .sorted, natsort

Suggested Approaches:
Stack
